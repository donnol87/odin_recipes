    <h4>Where did the Pale Ale come from?</h4>

         <p>Pale ale is a typically golden to amber coloured style of ale which is brewed using an ale yeast and predominantly pale malt.[1][2][3] 
        The term first appeared around 1703 for beers made from malts dried with high-carbon coke, which resulted in a lighter colour 
        than other beers popular at that time. Different brewing practices and hop quantities have resulted in a range of tastes and 
        strengths within the pale ale family.</p>
